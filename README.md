BeMyTutor

The business idea for BeMyTutor.com is creating a website offering tutoring services online from
customer to customer (C-to-C). It is an e-commerce business with all dimensions being online,
the customer and the seller are online and the service also takes place on the website itself, so
there are no physical elements to it.
The goal of the website is to match students with a tutor that satisfies their needs perfectly.
From our own personal experience and the ones of our peers during our years as
undergraduate and now graduate students, we have identified things students would look for in
a service that supports them in their schoolwork
